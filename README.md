This is the back-end coding of a program that receives a file with data, then processing it and exports 
the relevant data type txt,md or html.

-An example is the following:
1)We load the program the Countries, the type of destruction of each country, the 
  years and values of the specific destruction through a tsv file.
2)The user chooses a filter in gui and calculates the descriptive stats, the regression and 
  displays all of them in gui.
3)Then, the user chooses to export the file with the filtered data with the above types

That's all the back-end program does.
